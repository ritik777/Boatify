# Web-Scraping-Data-Analysis
This project deals with webscraping the data from www.boattrader.com. details of boats in that website is scraped and statistical analysis is done on pricing of the boat along with data visualization for inferences and stories.

Used python programming to scrap the details on www.boattrader.com and the script can be found at SDM_web_Scraping.ipynb

---uses a loop that goes to every image on every page. Script scraps details all around the image tab and dumps details to the excel file. 

---Since at a time only 30 pages can be traversed by the loop, I ran the script multiple times till enough data is obtained for analysis.

Ingested the data in R for Analysis

---Implemented various modelling techniques(Regression models, OLS testing for assumptions, running non-parametric regression models, Mixed effects regression model (Interaction variables)) on price.
